# Automata-Latex (Version 1.0)
Latex package to simplify making diagrams for DFAs using Tikz. The package, called "dfatex" makes it easier for a user to create DFAs with pre-defined styling.

# Installing the Package
After downloading the .sty file, you will need to place it in the tex/latex/dfatex/ folder in your TDS Structure. Note that you will have create the dfatex folder inside tex/latex/ as well. If you do not have a TDS Structure, refer to this link (http://latex.silmaril.ie/formattinginformation/pkginst.html) that can help you build one. TDS Structures will be useful for you to manually install packages and classes. 

# Usage
Refer to the documentation.pdf file in the repository for more information on usage.

# Future Updates
I will be adding a new feature allowing you to use a single command to create all the transitions.
